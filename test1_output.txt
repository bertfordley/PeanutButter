In response to abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought stress signals, binds directly to the promoters of RBOHC and RBOHE genes, encoding ROS biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in ROS accumulation and triggering leaf senescence via programmed cell death (PCD). ROS-induced leaf senescence sustains plant survival under drought conditions (PubMed:22313226). Involved in heat stress response. Modulates PCD through a ROS-mediated positive feedback control under heat stress conditions. This may provide an adaptation strategy for plant survival under extreme heat stress conditions (PubMed:25219309).

Promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during drought-induced leaf senescence. In response to abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought stress signals, binds directly to the promoters of RBOHC and RBOHE genes, encoding ROS biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in ROS accumulation and triggering leaf senescence via programmed cell death (PCD). ROS-induced leaf senescence sustains plant survival under drought conditions (PubMed:22313226). Involved in heat stress response. Modulates PCD through a ROS-mediated positive feedback control under heat stress conditions. This may provide an adaptation strategy for plant survival under extreme heat stress conditions (PubMed:25219309). Acts as repressor in preventing anther dehiscence during stamen development by suppressing genes that participate in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, such as DAD1, AOS, AOC3, OPR3 and 4CLL5/OPCL1 (PubMed:24323506).

Component of a DREAM-like complex which modulates a variety of developmentally regulated genes and of the mitotic genes in proliferating and differentiated cells. Associates with CDKA-1, RBR1 and E2FB, but not with E2FC, in proliferating cells, at early stages of leaves development. 	In EDC plants, defects of cytokinesis (PubMed:25806785). The double mutant myb3r1 myb3r4 often fails to complete cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleate cells with gapped walls and cell wall stubs in diverse tissues (e.g. in embryo during the first or second division after fertilization, in stomata guard mother cell) and several pleiotropic developmental defects, and associated with the selective reduction of several G2/M phase-specific genes transcript levels (e.g. CYCB2, CDC20.1 and KNOLLE). Hypersensitivity to caffeine, an inhibitor of cytokinesis (PubMed:17287251, PubMed:21862669). Impaired powdery mildew (e.g. G.orontii)-induced endoreduplication. Reduced G.orontii growth and reproduction leading to an enhanced resistance to powdery mildew (PubMed:20018666).
